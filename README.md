# The Green Trees initiative

This is a basic project putting [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS version 2 together with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
I have downloaded a UI kit on Behance that you can find [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/71348061/Non-profit-UI-Kit) in order to integrate the design. For the moment I have created the landing page, that I have integrated with Tailwind. The landing page is mobile first, and responsive.

## Live version
You can find the live version on Netlify right [here](https://the-greentrees-initiative.netlify.app/)

## Usage

To get going, simply fork the repo and run the following commands.

-   **Development:**
    `yarn start` will run a development server with hot reloading at <localhost:1234>
-   **Production:**
    `yarn build` will bundle everything up on your `/dist` folder
